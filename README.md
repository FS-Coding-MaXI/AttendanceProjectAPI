# Attendance Project API

The Attendance Project API is a FastAPI application with a PostgreSQL database, designed to manage attendance for various classes and meetings. This README outlines how to set up and run the application using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

These tools are required to build and run the containers for the application and its database.

## Project Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://yourrepository.com/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

## Configuration
1. Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project. This file should contain all the necessary environment variables required by the application:
``` plaintext
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db/attendanceproject
SECRET_KEY=YourSecretKeyHere
```

2. Docker Compose:
The project includes a docker-compose.yml file which defines the services, networks, and volumes for the application and the PostgreSQL database.

## Building and Running the Application
To build and run the application using Docker Compose, execute the following command from the root of the project directory:
  
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
This command does the following:

- Builds the Docker image for the FastAPI application if it does not exist.
- Starts the FastAPI application and the PostgreSQL database.
- Binds the FastAPI application to port 8000 on your localhost.
- Persists PostgreSQL data using Docker volumes.

## Accessing the Application
Once the application is running, you can access it at:

```arduino
http://localhost:8000
```

The API documentation generated by FastAPI can be accessed at:
```bash
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

This interactive documentation allows you to test the API directly from your browser.

## Shutting Down the Application

To stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes created by Docker Compose, run:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Additional Commands
 
- To view logs for the services, use:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

- To execute commands inside the FastAPI container, use:
```bash
docker-compose exec webapp bash
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the application, checking the Docker container logs is often a good first step in diagnosing the problem.
